# Automated Discovery Implementation Summary

## Overview

TopDeck now includes fully automated resource discovery that runs continuously in the background, ensuring your cloud infrastructure topology is always up-to-date. This implementation addresses the requirement to prepare the app for real data testing with automated scans triggered by the app itself rather than manual population.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Background Scheduler Service (`src/topdeck/common/scheduler.py`)

A comprehensive scheduler service that:
- **Automatically runs on startup**: Initial discovery happens immediately when the API server starts
- **Periodic execution**: Rescans every 8 hours (configurable via `DISCOVERY_SCAN_INTERVAL`)
- **Multi-cloud support**: Discovers resources from Azure, AWS, and GCP in parallel
- **Credential-based activation**: Only runs for cloud providers with valid credentials configured
- **Smart execution**: Prevents concurrent discovery runs and validates credentials before starting
- **Graceful error handling**: Continues operating even if individual discovery runs fail
- **Resource storage**: Automatically stores discovered resources and dependencies in Neo4j

### 2. Discovery API Endpoints (`src/topdeck/api/routes/discovery.py`)

Two new REST API endpoints for managing discovery:

#### GET `/api/v1/discovery/status`
Returns current scheduler status including:
- Whether the scheduler is running
- Whether discovery is currently in progress
- When the last discovery ran
- Configured scan interval
- Which cloud providers are enabled and have credentials

#### POST `/api/v1/discovery/trigger`
Manually triggers a discovery scan:
- Useful for forcing immediate updates
- Returns error if discovery is already in progress
- Respects the same credential validation as scheduled scans

### 3. FastAPI Integration

- **Lifespan management**: Scheduler starts with the app and shuts down gracefully
- **Automatic initialization**: No manual setup required beyond configuration
- **Error isolation**: Scheduler failures don't prevent the API from starting

### 4. Configuration Updates

#### Default 8-hour Scan Interval
- Changed `DISCOVERY_SCAN_INTERVAL` from 3600 (1 hour) to 28800 (8 hours)
- Configurable via environment variable
- Can be customized per environment (e.g., shorter in dev, longer in prod)

#### Environment Variables
All discovery settings in `.env`:
```bash
DISCOVERY_SCAN_INTERVAL=28800  # 8 hours
DISCOVERY_PARALLEL_WORKERS=5
DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT=300

ENABLE_AZURE_DISCOVERY=true
ENABLE_AWS_DISCOVERY=true
ENABLE_GCP_DISCOVERY=true
```

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

#### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/test_scheduler.py`)
- 17 tests covering all scheduler functionality
- Tests for Azure, AWS, and GCP credential validation
- Tests for discovery execution and error handling
- Tests for manual triggering and status reporting
- All tests passing with 65% code coverage of scheduler module

#### API Tests (`tests/api/test_discovery_routes.py`)
- 5 tests for discovery API endpoints
- Tests for status retrieval and manual triggering
- Tests for error conditions
- All tests passing

#### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_scheduler_integration.py`)
- 5 tests verifying scheduler integrates with FastAPI
- Tests for app startup with scheduler
- Tests for endpoint availability
- Tests for graceful handling of missing credentials
- All tests passing

### 6. Documentation

- Complete documentation for automated discovery
- Configuration examples for all cloud providers
- API endpoint documentation with examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations
- FAQ section

#### Verification Script (`scripts/verify_scheduler.py`)
- Command-line tool to verify scheduler configuration
- Checks credentials for all cloud providers
- Validates scheduler settings
- Tests scheduler initialization
- Provides actionable feedback

#### Updated README
- Added link to automated discovery documentation
- Highlighted as a new feature

### 7. Dependencies

Added `apscheduler==3.10.4` for background task scheduling:
- Mature, stable library (15+ years of development)
- Async-compatible with FastAPI
- Flexible scheduling options (interval, cron, date-based)
- Thread-safe and production-ready

## How It Works

### Startup Flow

1. FastAPI app starts
2. Lifespan context manager calls `start_scheduler()`
3. Scheduler initializes and connects to Neo4j
4. Scheduler validates cloud provider credentials
5. If credentials found, initial discovery runs immediately
6. Scheduler sets up periodic job to run every 8 hours
7. API endpoints become available

### Discovery Execution

1. Scheduler timer triggers (every 8 hours)
2. For each enabled cloud provider with credentials:
   - Run discovery in parallel
   - Collect all resources and dependencies
   - Handle errors gracefully
3. Store all discovered resources in Neo4j
4. Update existing resources if they've changed
5. Log summary of what was discovered
6. Schedule next run

### Manual Trigger Flow

1. User calls `POST /api/v1/discovery/trigger`
2. Scheduler checks if discovery is already running
3. If not, schedules discovery to run immediately
4. Returns status to user
5. Discovery executes asynchronously

## Testing with Real Data

The app is now ready for real data testing:

### Prerequisites
1. Configure cloud provider credentials in `.env`
2. Start Neo4j: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Start API server: `make run`

### Verification Steps

1. **Check scheduler status**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/discovery/status
   ```

2. **Verify configuration**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/verify_scheduler.py
   ```

3. **Monitor logs**:
   - Check console output for discovery progress
   - Look for "Starting automated resource discovery"
   - Verify resources are being discovered and stored

4. **Query discovered resources**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/topology
   ```

5. **View in Neo4j**:
   - Open http://localhost:7474
   - Run: `MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 25`

### Example: Testing with Azure

1. Configure Azure credentials in `.env`:
   ```bash
   ENABLE_AZURE_DISCOVERY=true
   AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
   AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-subscription-id
   ```

2. Start the API:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

3. Watch the logs for:
   ```
   INFO: Starting automated resource discovery
   INFO: Discovering Azure resources...
   INFO: Azure discovery completed: 42 resources
   INFO: Stored 42 resources in Neo4j
   INFO: Automated discovery completed in 12.34s. Next run in 8 hours.
   ```

4. Verify resources were discovered:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/topology | jq '.nodes | length'
   ```
