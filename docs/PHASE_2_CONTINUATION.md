## Conclusion

Phase 2 network flow diagram documentation is **COMPLETE** âœ…

This work provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing TopDeck's topology visualization dashboard (Issue #6). The detailed network flow patterns for Azure, AWS, and GCP, along with multi-cloud scenarios, security patterns, and performance optimizations, will guide the development of an interactive visualization tool that helps users understand their infrastructure topology and data flows.

The documentation directly addresses the user's request for "a complete network flow diagram of how the data is flowing from major resources like pods to lb to gateway to storage account and so on." These patterns are now documented and ready to be implemented as part of the visualization dashboard.
