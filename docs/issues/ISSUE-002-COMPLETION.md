# Issue #2: Core Data Models - Completion Report

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Completed**: 2025-10-12  
**Related Issues**: #1 (Technology Stack), #3 (Azure Discovery)

## Overview

Issue #2 focused on designing and implementing core data models for TopDeck's graph database. The goal was to create a comprehensive, cloud-agnostic data model that can represent cloud resources, applications, code repositories, and their relationships.

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Neo4j Schema Design

**File**: `docs/architecture/neo4j-schema.cypher`

Complete Neo4j schema with:
- 6 node types: Resource, Application, Repository, Deployment, Namespace, Pod
- 13 relationship types: DEPENDS_ON, CONNECTS_TO, CONTAINS, DEPLOYED_TO, BUILT_FROM, etc.
- 34 indexes for query performance
- 6 uniqueness constraints for data integrity
- Existence constraints for critical properties (Enterprise Edition)

### ✅ Comprehensive Documentation

**File**: `docs/architecture/data-models.md`

1,213-line documentation covering:
- All node types with complete property definitions
- All relationship types with property schemas
- Specific resource type schemas (AKS, App Service, VM, SQL, VNet, etc.)
- Common query patterns with Cypher examples
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Schema evolution strategy
- Integration with Azure SDK

### ✅ Python Data Models

**File**: `src/topdeck/discovery/models.py`

Implemented cloud-agnostic Python data models:

1. **DiscoveredResource**
   - Represents any cloud infrastructure resource
   - Cloud-agnostic properties (id, name, type, provider, region, status, etc.)
   - Cloud-specific properties stored as flexible JSON
   - Converts to Neo4j properties via `to_neo4j_properties()`
   
2. **Application**
   - Represents deployed applications/services
   - Ownership info (team, email, business unit)
   - Code linkage (repository URL, deployment method)
   - Health metrics (score, availability, error rate, response time)
   - Version and deployment tracking
   
3. **Repository**
   - Represents code repositories (GitHub, Azure DevOps, GitLab)
   - Branch and commit information
   - Repository metadata (description, language, topics)
   - Activity metrics (stars, forks, issues, contributors)
   
4. **Deployment**
   - Represents deployment events/pipeline runs
   - Version and artifact information
   - Deployment details (status, duration, environment)
   - Change management (ticket ID, approval status, approvers)
   - Target resources tracking
   
5. **ResourceDependency**
   - Represents dependencies between resources
   - Category (network, data, configuration, compute)
   - Type (required, optional, strong, weak)
   - Strength (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Discovery metadata

6. **DiscoveryResult**
   - Container for discovery operation results
   - Lists of resources, dependencies, applications, repositories, deployments
   - Error tracking
   - Timing and metrics
   - Summary generation

### ✅ Neo4j Client Implementation

**File**: `src/topdeck/storage/neo4j_client.py`

Enhanced Neo4j client with full support for all node types:

**Resource Operations**:
- `create_resource()` - Create resource node
- `upsert_resource()` - Create or update resource
- `get_resource_by_id()` - Retrieve resource
- `get_resources_by_type()` - Query by type

**Application Operations**:
- `create_application()` - Create application node
- `upsert_application()` - Create or update application

**Repository Operations**:
- `create_repository()` - Create repository node
- `upsert_repository()` - Create or update repository

**Deployment Operations**:
- `create_deployment()` - Create deployment node
- `upsert_deployment()` - Create or update deployment

**Relationship Operations**:
- `create_dependency()` - Create DEPENDS_ON relationship
- `create_relationship()` - Create any relationship type between any nodes
- `get_dependencies()` - Get all dependencies for a resource

**Utility Operations**:
- `connect()` / `close()` - Connection management
- `session()` - Context manager for sessions
- `clear_all()` - Delete all data (testing/dev)

### ✅ Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Files**: 
- `tests/discovery/test_models.py` (240+ lines)
- `tests/discovery/azure/test_mapper.py` (existing, 200+ lines)
- `tests/discovery/azure/test_devops.py` (new, 280+ lines)

**Test Coverage**:
- DiscoveredResource creation and Neo4j conversion
- Application model with all properties
- Repository model with all properties
- Deployment model with all properties
- DiscoveryResult with adding and counting entities
- Azure DevOps metadata extraction
- Application inference from resources
- All tag variant patterns

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Cloud-Agnostic Core Model

**Decision**: Create normalized models that work across Azure, AWS, GCP.

**Rationale**:
- Enables multi-cloud support from day one
- Simplifies graph queries (consistent schema)
- Provides consistent API for all cloud providers
- Cloud-specific properties stored in flexible `properties` field

**Trade-off**: Need mapper layer per cloud provider, but worth it for flexibility.

### 2. Python Dataclasses

**Decision**: Use Python dataclasses for models instead of Pydantic or custom classes.

**Rationale**:
- Simple, clean, Pythonic
- Built-in support for default values and factories
- Type hints for IDE support
- Easy to serialize to dict/JSON
- Can add Pydantic later if needed for validation

### 3. Separate Discovery Models from Neo4j Schema

**Decision**: Discovery models are Python objects that convert to Neo4j via `to_neo4j_properties()`.

**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Discovery layer doesn't need to know Neo4j details
- Easier to test (no database required)
- Can change Neo4j schema without changing discovery code
- Can add other storage backends (SQL, MongoDB) later

### 4. Properties as JSON String

**Decision**: Store cloud-specific properties as JSON string in Neo4j.

**Rationale**:
- Flexible schema (different properties per resource type)
- No need to update schema for new resource types
- Can store arbitrary Azure/AWS/GCP properties
- Easy to query and parse when needed
- Neo4j can query JSON with `apoc.convert.fromJsonMap()`

**Alternative Considered**: Dynamic node properties - rejected due to schema complexity and query difficulty.

### 5. Generic Relationship Creation

**Decision**: Added `create_relationship()` method that works for any node types and relationship types.

**Rationale**:
- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
- Easy to add new relationship types without changing code
- Supports all 13 relationship types from schema
- Flexible for future extensions

## Example Usage

### Discovering and Storing Resources

```python
from topdeck.discovery.azure import AzureDiscoverer
from topdeck.storage.neo4j_client import Neo4jClient

# Discover resources
discoverer = AzureDiscoverer(subscription_id="...")
result = await discoverer.discover_all_resources()

# Store in Neo4j
client = Neo4jClient("bolt://localhost:7687", "neo4j", "password")
client.connect()

# Store resources
for resource in result.resources:
    client.upsert_resource(resource.to_neo4j_properties())

# Store applications
for app in result.applications:
    client.upsert_application(app.to_neo4j_properties())

# Store repositories
for repo in result.repositories:
    client.upsert_repository(repo.to_neo4j_properties())

# Store dependencies
for dep in result.dependencies:
    client.create_dependency(
        dep.source_id,
        dep.target_id,
        dep.to_neo4j_properties(),
    )

# Create application relationships
for app in result.applications:
    if app.repository_url:
        # Link app to repository (BUILT_FROM)
        client.create_relationship(
            app.id, "Application",
            repo.id, "Repository",
            "BUILT_FROM",
            {"branch": "main"}
        )
```

### Creating Application Topology

```python
from topdeck.discovery.models import Application, Repository, Deployment

# Create application
app = Application(
    id="app-ecommerce-prod",
    name="E-commerce Platform",
    environment="prod",
    owner_team="platform-team",
    deployment_method="aks",
    current_version="v2.3.1",
    health_score=95.5,
)

# Create repository
repo = Repository(
    id="repo-github-ecommerce",
    platform="github",
    url="https://github.com/company/ecommerce",
    name="ecommerce",
    default_branch="main",
    last_commit_sha="abc123",
)

# Create deployment
deployment = Deployment(
    id="deploy-123",
    pipeline_id="pipeline-456",
    version="v2.3.1",
    status="success",
    environment="prod",
    commit_sha="abc123",
    deployed_by="user@company.com",
    target_resources=["/subscriptions/.../aks-cluster"],
)

# Store in Neo4j
client.upsert_application(app.to_neo4j_properties())
client.upsert_repository(repo.to_neo4j_properties())
client.upsert_deployment(deployment.to_neo4j_properties())

# Create relationships
client.create_relationship(
    app.id, "Application",
    repo.id, "Repository",
    "BUILT_FROM",
    {"branch": "main", "commit_sha": "abc123"}
)

client.create_relationship(
    deployment.id, "Deployment",
