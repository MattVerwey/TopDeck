# Issue #1: Technology Stack Decision

**Labels**: `enhancement`, `discussion`, `priority: high`, `phase-1`

## Description

We need to make a decision on the core technology stack for TopDeck before beginning development. This decision will affect all subsequent development work.

## Requirements

The chosen stack should support:
1. **Multi-cloud SDK integration** (Azure, AWS, GCP)
2. **Graph database operations** (Neo4j)
3. **REST API development** with good performance
4. **Async/concurrent operations** for cloud resource scanning
5. **Strong typing** for maintainability
6. **Good ecosystem** for cloud and DevOps tools
7. **Team expertise** and learning curve considerations

## Options to Consider

### Option 1: Python Stack
**Backend**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
**Pros**:
- Excellent cloud SDKs (Azure SDK, Boto3, Google Cloud SDK)
- FastAPI provides modern, fast API framework
- Rich ecosystem for data processing
- Type hints available
- Great for scripting and automation

**Cons**:
- Performance vs compiled languages
- GIL limitations for true parallelism

### Option 2: Go Stack
**Backend**: Go 1.21+ with Gin or Echo
**Pros**:
- Excellent performance and concurrency
- Native compilation
- Strong typing
- Good cloud SDKs available
- Fast startup times

**Cons**:
- Less familiar to some developers
- Smaller ecosystem than Python
- More verbose code

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
**Backend API**: Go for performance
**Discovery Workers**: Python for cloud SDK richness
**Pros**:
- Best of both worlds
- Use right tool for each job

**Cons**:
- More complex deployment
- Multiple codebases to maintain

## Frontend

**Recommendation**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- Modern, widely adopted
- Great visualization libraries (D3.js, Cytoscape.js)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Strong component ecosystem

## Database & Infrastructure

- **Graph DB**: Neo4j (industry standard for graph data)
- **Cache**: Redis (fast, reliable)
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes

## Decision Criteria

1. Development speed vs runtime performance
2. Cloud SDK maturity and ease of use
3. Team expertise and onboarding
4. Long-term maintainability
5. Community support and libraries

## Action Items

- [ ] Research cloud SDK maturity for Python vs Go
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept for Azure discovery in both languages
- [ ] Evaluate performance for graph operations
- [ ] Consider team skills and preferences
- [ ] Document decision in ADR-001

## Timeline

Decision needed by: End of Week 1
