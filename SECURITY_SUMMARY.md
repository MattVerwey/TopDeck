# Security Summary - Enhanced Dependency Mapping

## CodeQL Analysis Results

### Alerts Found: 2

Both alerts are **false positives** for our use case and do not represent security vulnerabilities.

### Alert 1: URL Substring Check in Connection Parser

**Location**: `src/topdeck/discovery/connection_parser.py:119`

**Alert**: "The string [amazonaws.com] may be at an arbitrary position in the sanitized URL"

**Analysis**: 
- **Not a vulnerability**: This code is parsing connection strings to identify AWS S3 endpoints
- **Purpose**: Dependency discovery, not security validation
- **Safe because**: 
  - We are identifying service endpoints, not performing authentication/authorization
  - The pattern is used to extract bucket names from S3 URLs
  - No security decisions are based on this substring match
  - The extracted information is used for topology mapping only

**Mitigation**: None needed - this is the intended behavior

### Alert 2: URL Substring Check in Test Code

**Location**: `tests/discovery/test_monitoring_dependency_discovery.py:290`

**Alert**: "The string [mydb.database.windows.net] may be at an arbitrary position in the sanitized URL"

**Analysis**:
- **Not a vulnerability**: This is test code with a sample connection string
- **Purpose**: Unit test validation
- **Safe because**: Test code does not run in production

**Mitigation**: None needed - test data only

## Security Considerations

### 1. Connection String Handling ✅

**What we do**:
- Parse connection strings to extract endpoints
- Store only the host/endpoint information, NOT credentials
- Never log or expose passwords or API keys

**Code example**:
```python
# We extract ONLY the host, not the password
conn_info = parser.parse_connection_string(
    "postgresql://user:PASSWORD@host:5432/db"
)
# conn_info.host = "host"
# conn_info.password = NOT STORED
```

### 2. Monitoring Data Access ✅

**What we do**:
- Read-only access to Loki and Prometheus
- No modification of logs or metrics
- Aggregate patterns only, not sensitive data

**Safeguards**:
- HTTP client with configurable timeouts
- Exception handling to prevent crashes
- No sensitive data in discovered dependencies

### 3. Neo4j Storage ✅

**What we store**:
- Resource IDs (already public within the cloud account)
- Endpoint hostnames (e.g., "mydb.database.windows.net")
- Dependency relationships
- Confidence scores and discovery methods

**What we DON'T store**:
- ❌ Passwords
- ❌ API keys
- ❌ Connection string credentials
- ❌ Secrets from Key Vault / Secrets Manager
- ❌ Raw log messages with sensitive data

### 4. Code Injection Protection ✅

**Regular expressions used**:
- All regex patterns use raw strings (r"pattern")
- No user input directly in regex compilation
- Patterns are pre-compiled class attributes
- No eval() or exec() used anywhere

### 5. Input Validation ✅

**Connection string parsing**:
```python
def parse_connection_string(connection_string: str) -> ConnectionInfo | None:
    if not connection_string:
        return None
    # Safe parsing with try/except
    try:
        # Use urlparse and regex, no eval
        parsed = urlparse(connection_string)
        # ...
    except Exception:
        return None  # Fail safely
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### ✅ Principle of Least Privilege
- Read-only access to monitoring systems
- No modification of cloud resources
- No storage of credentials

### ✅ Defense in Depth
- Multiple validation layers
- Exception handling at all levels
- Fail-safe defaults (return None on error)

### ✅ Secure by Default
- No automatic credential extraction
- Conservative confidence thresholds
- Explicit user opt-in for monitoring analysis

### ✅ Transparency
- All discovery methods documented
- Clear logging of discovery sources
- Audit trail in Neo4j (discovered_method field)

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

### 1. Network Security
- Deploy Loki/Prometheus in a secure network
- Use HTTPS for all monitoring endpoints
- Implement proper firewall rules

### 2. Access Control
- Use service accounts with read-only permissions
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Implement audit logging

### 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt Neo4j connections (TLS)
- Use encrypted storage for Neo4j database
- Implement backup and disaster recovery

### 4. Monitoring
- Monitor access to Loki/Prometheus
- Alert on unusual dependency discovery patterns
- Track confidence scores over time

## Conclusion

The enhanced dependency mapping implementation is **secure** for production use:

✅ No credential storage
✅ Read-only operations
✅ Proper input validation
✅ Exception handling
✅ No code injection vulnerabilities
✅ Clear audit trail

The two CodeQL alerts are **false positives** and do not represent security risks. They flag URL substring checks that are intentionally used for service endpoint identification, not for security validation.

## Encryption and Security Configuration

### Data Encryption Support

TopDeck now includes comprehensive encryption support for data at rest and in transit:

#### Data in Transit (TLS/SSL)
- ✅ **API Server**: HTTPS support with SSL certificates
- ✅ **Neo4j**: Encrypted connections using `bolt+s://` protocol
- ✅ **Redis**: SSL/TLS encryption for cache connections
- ✅ **RabbitMQ**: SSL/TLS encryption for message queue

#### Data at Rest
- ✅ **Neo4j**: Enterprise Edition encryption at rest support
- ✅ **Volume Encryption**: Filesystem and cloud volume encryption
- ✅ **Credential Protection**: Secure environment variable handling

### Configuration Options

All encryption features are **opt-in** and controlled via environment variables:

```bash
# Enable HTTPS for API
SSL_ENABLED=true
SSL_KEYFILE=/path/to/server.key
SSL_CERTFILE=/path/to/server.crt

# Enable Neo4j encryption
NEO4J_ENCRYPTED=true
NEO4J_URI=bolt+s://your-host:7687

# Enable Redis encryption
REDIS_SSL=true

# Enable RabbitMQ encryption
RABBITMQ_SSL=true
```

### Production Security Validation

TopDeck validates security configuration on startup:
- ❌ **Fails** if default secret key is used in production
- ⚠️  **Warns** if encryption is disabled for databases
- ⚠️  **Warns** if API SSL is disabled
