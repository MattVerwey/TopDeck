```

#### Key Features
- **Responsive design** with Material-UI Grid system
- **Dark theme** for modern, sleek appearance
- **Color-coded visualizations** for easy identification
- **Loading states** for better UX
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **TypeScript** for type safety throughout

### 4. Visualization Libraries

#### Cytoscape.js for Network Topology
- Interactive node-link diagram
- Custom node styling by cloud provider
- Edge relationships with arrows
- Pan and zoom functionality
- Node selection and details

#### Recharts for Charts
- Bar charts for risk distribution
- Responsive container sizing
- Custom tooltips and legends
- Dark theme integration

### 5. API Integration

The frontend connects to backend APIs:
```typescript
- GET /api/v1/topology
- GET /api/v1/topology/resources/{id}/dependencies
- GET /api/v1/topology/flows
- GET /api/v1/monitoring/resources/{id}/metrics
- GET /api/v1/integrations
- POST /api/v1/risk/impact
```

### 6. State Management

Using Zustand for:
- Topology data
- Selected resources
- Filter states
- View mode selection
- Risk assessments
- Integration configurations
- Loading/error states

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Run development server
npm run dev
# Access at http://localhost:3000

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Screenshots

All features are fully functional and demonstrated in the screenshots provided in the PR description:

1. **Dashboard** - Showing metrics overview with modern design
2. **Topology** - Interactive graph with view mode and filter controls
3. **Change Impact** - ServiceNow/Jira analysis interface with impact metrics
4. **Integrations** - Plugin management with enable/configure options

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| React | 18 | UI framework |
| TypeScript | Latest | Type safety |
| Vite | 7 | Build tool |
| Material-UI | 7 | Component library |
| Cytoscape.js | Latest | Network visualization |
| Recharts | Latest | Charts and graphs |
| Zustand | Latest | State management |
| React Router | 6 | Navigation |

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Dark Theme
Chosen for modern, professional appearance and reduced eye strain during extended use.

### 2. Material-UI
Provides comprehensive component library with excellent TypeScript support and customization.

### 3. Cytoscape.js
Industry-standard for network graph visualization with excellent performance and interactivity.

### 4. Zustand over Redux
Simpler API, less boilerplate, sufficient for current complexity.

### 5. Vite over Create React App
Faster development, better HMR, modern build tooling.

2. **frontend/README.md** - Quick start guide
3. **docs/UI_GUIDE.md** - Detailed usage documentation
4. **This file** - Implementation summary

## Deployment Ready

The frontend is production-ready and can be deployed:
- Build artifacts are optimized
- Environment variables are configurable
- CORS is properly configured
- Error boundaries are in place

The frontend expects the backend to:
1. Run on `http://localhost:8000` (configurable)
2. Provide the topology API endpoints
3. Enable CORS for frontend origin
4. Return data in expected JSON format
