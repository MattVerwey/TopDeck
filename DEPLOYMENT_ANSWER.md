## What's Not Complete (But Doesn't Block Testing)

### ⚠️ Future Enhancements

**AWS/GCP Orchestrators** (Phase 4)
- Status: Mappers ready, orchestrators pending
- Impact: Can't discover AWS/GCP yet
- Workaround: Use Azure for test environment
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks

**Monitoring Integration** (Phase 3)
- Status: Backend collectors ready, integration incomplete
- Impact: Can't correlate live metrics yet
- Workaround: Use discovery and risk analysis
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks

**Real-time Updates** (Future)
- Status: Not implemented
- Impact: Manual refresh needed
- Workaround: Refresh page
- Timeline: Future enhancement

**Production Hardening** (Phase 5)
- Status: Not started
- Impact: Not ready for production scale
- Workaround: Use for test/dev only
- Timeline: 2-3 months
